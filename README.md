## Download

**[Download Montri v1.0](https://github.com/ArturGuedes/Montri/releases/download/v1.0/Montri.app.zip)**

## Motivation

Before macOS Mojave (10.14), there was no native keyboard shortcut to toggle the visibility of hidden files in Finder. Users had to either:

- Use Terminal commands
- Install third-party applications
- Memorize complex workflows

Montri was created to bridge this gap by providing a simple, accessible menu bar interface that makes toggling hidden file visibility as easy as a single click.

## Features

- **One-click toggle**: Show or hide hidden files instantly from the menu bar
- **Native integration**: Uses macOS system preferences to ensure compatibility
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage with a clean, simple interface
- **Localized**: Available in Portuguese (Brazil) with easy language support
- **No shortcuts required**: Perfect for users who prefer GUI over keyboard shortcuts

## Target Audience

This application is particularly useful for:

- **Legacy macOS users** (pre-Mojave) who need hidden file access
- **Developers and power users** working with configuration files and system directories
- **Users who prefer menu bar utilities** over keyboard shortcuts
- **Anyone who frequently needs to toggle hidden file visibility**

## Compatibility

- Designed for macOS versions prior to Mojave (10.14)
- Still functional on newer versions as an alternative to Cmd+Shift+.
- Requires macOS with Finder application
